# sudoku_solver
Made a Sudoku solver by implementing backtracking algorithm in which we can fill partially satisfying the condition that no two rows or columns can have a duplicate element and also 3*3 grid cannot have a duplicate value in it. This algorithm will generate all the possible answers that we can have which satisfies the above conditions and will return one of them. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript to build the web application of it and to show case real life examples of Data Structures and Algorithms.
